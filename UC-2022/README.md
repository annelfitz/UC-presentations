### ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Advanced Topics
Presenters: Anne Fitz, Kristian Ekenes, Jeremy Bartley
Date/Time/Location: 
  - Tuesday, July 12 | 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM | SDCC Room 07 AB
  - Thursday, July 14 | 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM | SDCC Room 16 A

This session will discuss and demonstrate advanced visualization and analytical techniques that are performed client-side. Client-side refers to computations that are performed in the browser without needing to communicate with a server and as such are often very performant. The presenters will discuss vector filtering, highlighting and analysis such as geometric operations and coordinate projection. We'll also demonstrate how you can leverage multi-layer vector symbols to create dynamic data-driven visualizations. These techniques are essential for building interactive and engaging apps.
